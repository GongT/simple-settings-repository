# simple setting repository

### a `Too Young, Too Simple` IDEA config file sync.

Just backup and restore config files ( with some ignore ).

No any export/import actions. Extreme stable.

But you must quit IDE before restore any settings. And `git` must run by hand.

Do not support cross different OS.

Do not have any AUTO merge action like official settingRepository plugin.
